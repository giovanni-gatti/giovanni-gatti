**Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

My name is **Giovanni Gatti** and I live in Milan, Italy.\
I am currently pursuing the MSc in Artificial Intelligence @ Bocconi University.\
I am a Visiting Research Student in the Computational Biology Lab in the Department of Computing Sciences @ Bocconi, and I have experience working as an AI Engineer.\
During the day, I like to work on projects related to Deep Learning, and Machine Learning in general, particularly in the Computational Biology domain.\
During the night (and very early mornings too), I love to run.

Feel free to drop me an email at:\
