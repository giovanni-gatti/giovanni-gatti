**Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

My name is **Giovanni Gatti** and I live in Milan, Italy.\
I am currently pursuing the MSc in Artificial Intelligence @ Bocconi University.\
On top of that, I am working full-time as an AI Engineer @ Target Reply, and I am a Visiting Research Student in the Department of Computing Sciences @ Bocconi.\
During the day, I like to work on projects related to LLMs, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning in general.\
During the night (and very early mornings too), I love to run.

Feel free to drop me an email at:\
